# About

Hey! Thank you for checking out my site üòä

I am a {{ (new Date().getFullYear()) - 1994 }} year old full stack developer living and working out of Sydney, Australia.


## Overview

### üë®‚Äçüíª Working full time for myself 

Starting December 2020, I have moved to working for myself full time.

The previous 6 years I have felt a consistent buzz of burn out: working full time, freelancing and doing side projects. 
There was never enough time to do everything I wanted. I couldn't get to my freelance clients promptly,
I couldn't be 100% focused at work and couldn't finish side projects.

I have no idea how long I can last, but at least I now have better balance. The goal is to earn enough money to support
working for myself.

### :hammer: Trying to build profitable SaaS projects with Laravel & Vue

The primary way I want to support myself is through building projects myself. Laravel and Vue are the stacks I spend most of my time with.

I've been working on a side project for the past 6 months, I haven't made a lot of progress, but I plan to launch the
landing page and share details soon.

### :writing_hand: Sharing my journey along the way

I want to be able to motivate others to take the plunge into the unknown, the best way I can do that is by sharing my 
journey and making it work.

I'll be posting here, <a href="https://twitter.com/harlan_zw" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/harlanzw" target="_blank">IndieHackers</a> for now.



### :money_with_wings: $0 MMR so far

Being transparent about how my journey is going is important to me. I want people to see what it really takes to move the needle.
I plan to build my projects in public, you'll see my MMR be updated as I go along.
